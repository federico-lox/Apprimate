Apprimate
=========

Web friendly app development.

This project has been **discontinued** in favor of the excellent [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), the code will remain public in case it might help other developers in search for examples on how to use QT's Webkit integration.

The [qt-mac](https://github.com/federico-lox/Apprimate/tree/master/src/lib/qt-mac) folder might also be of interest for those dealing with QT on Mac OSX.
